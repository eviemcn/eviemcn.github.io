        <p>
          I am a front-end website developer and designer with interest in graph
          databases and API. <br />
          Initially, this website was used to help gain further skills using
          HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have now rewritten the site using
          Typescript and React as I have become more familiar using these.
          <br />
          My interests include design, music, art, film and food. I hope to
          incorporate these into this website somehow. <br />
          The website is currently being hosted on Github,{" "}
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/eviemcn/eviemcn.github.io"
          >
            here is a link
          </a>{" "}
          if youâ€™d like to take a look at the code.
        </p>
      </TextWrapper>
    </div>
  );
